..=hello? Can you hear me?
I have no idea what's...
This screen is flashing loudly at me to tell you:
"Keep moving and follow the train tracks"
I don't know what that means.

Apparently you're doing the right thing, the screen has changed.
I can now see your position, power level, suit pressure, air sup...
Oh... oh my. No no no no no...
You have barely any air and it's dwindling fast.
You're going to have to really book it.
There's a button on the screen to turn on your HUD. You'll see what I mean...

Ah! The computer is doing that flashing thing again.
"Reach the base and power on the tracking signal"
I still have no clue what any of all of this means.
Give me a moment to see if I can figure things out.

I just woke up from cryo sleep with blaring and lights flashing everywhere.
Everything was screaming at me to get to this computer.
And everything is so very dusty, not great for my allergies.
Ok, I found a folder here.
It says "Classified: Carrington Observatory". Doesn't ring a bell.
And of course all the pages inside is faded, unreadable.
